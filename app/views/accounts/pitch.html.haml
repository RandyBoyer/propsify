    %h3 Referrals are like gold
    %p 
      If you look at your current business, you'll notice one striking
      fact â€“ that the chunk of your clients comes to you via referrals.
    %p
      For most, referrals happen accidentally. What if those valuable referrals happen intentionally?
      When than happens, people will find you. God knows how,
      but they will.

    %h3 Recommendations eliminate hesitations
    %p
      Customers hate the feeling of playing the guinea pig (who isn't?).
      They want to know they are not the first one to try you out.
      They want to hear from  Kate, Hannah, Scott, Gabriel, Kim, and
      dozens of others who were your clients before and would be
      happy to recommend you to anyone.
    %p 
      If someone else says how great you are, how kind you are, or how wonderful you
      can be, it reduces the fear from your potential clients of making the
      wrong decision.  It's about you but unlike advertising, someone
      else is saying it. 

    %h3 Give your raving fans a megaphone 

    %p

      It's like giving your happy customers a megaphone and letting them tell 
      the whole world how awesome you are.
