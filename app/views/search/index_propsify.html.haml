        Propsify gives your customers ability to post their recommendations in Twitter and Facebook
        (coming next). It helps spread the great things about your business.
        It's like an advertisement but a real customer is saying it.

    Why Propsify?
  %p
    Trust is the biggest stumbling block in your customerâ€™s brain.
    No matter how big or shiny your advertisements are,  customers
    don't trust you. They need you. They think you're the best man
    for the job. But they are afraid of making the wrong decision.
   
  %h4
    Customers want recommendations
  %p 
    Recommendations reduce risks for your customers. If someone else 
    says how great you are, how kind you are, or how wonderful you 
    can be, it reduces the fear from your customers of making the 
    wrong decision.  It's about your business but unlike advertising, 
    someone else is saying it. It's more believable. It's more credible.
